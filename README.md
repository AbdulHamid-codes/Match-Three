# Match-Three
This was the semster project for the course "CS-217 Object Oriented Programming" of my BS-Computer Science where, 
I developed a "match-three" game designed using Oriented Programming. The project is implemented using open Gl and written 
in C++. The focus was object Oriented Programming so only a signle global variable was used in the entire project. 
This is "make file" project developed in ubuntu. 
To run the game:
-> Extract all the files in one directory
-> Open linux terminal in this directory
-> Type "make" on termianl and enter
-> Type "Game" on terminal and enter 
-> The game window will open up
