# Match-Three
This was the semster project for the course "CS-217 Object Oriented Programming" of my BS-Computer Science where, 
I developed a "match-three" game designed using Oriented Programming. The project is implemented using open Gl and written 
in C++. The focus was object Oriented Programming so only a signle global variable was used in the entire project. 
This is "make file" project developed in ubuntu.
